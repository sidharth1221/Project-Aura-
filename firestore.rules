/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the AuraTwin platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles. Each user can only
 * access and modify their own profile data. For features like the "Recent Activity" feed,
 * authenticated users are permitted to list user documents, as the feed is a core part of the
 * dashboard experience.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * User profiles are stored in the `/users/{userId}` collection, where `{userId}` corresponds
 * to the Firebase Authentication UID of the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own profiles.
 * - Authenticated users are allowed to list users to populate the dashboard.
 * - Schema validation is enforced on update to ensure data integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` is part of the path (`/users/{userId}`) and mirrored in the document's `id` field. This denormalization avoids the need for costly `get()` calls to determine user ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring clear ownership and preventing accidental public exposure.
